SDKMAN! (The Software Development Kit Manager)

This tool makes installing Groovy on any Bash platform (Mac OSX, Linux, Cygwin, Solaris or FreeBSD) very easy.
Simply open a new terminal and enter:

$ curl -s get.sdkman.io | bash

Follow the instructions on-screen to complete installation.
Open a new terminal or type the command:

$ source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"

Then install the latest stable Groovy:

$ sdk install groovy

After installation is complete and you've made it your default version, test it with:

$ groovy -version

That's all there is to it!
